# Presentation Summary

My presentation is about [bias on robotics](https://github.com/cswpy/RobotaPsyche/blob/master/Presentation/Into%20the%20Minds%20of%20Robots.pdf). I start with a real-life scenario where human HR and an algorithmic evaluation model is compared and demonstrated a game called [Survival of the Best Fit](https://www.survivalofthebestfit.com/), which shows how machine learning models could be biased unintentionally. Later, I introduce the concept of **Implicit Bias**, a fundamental idea to comprehend as it is integral to humans and the creations we develop. Then, I use bias in autonomous car as an example, and talks about a research initiative called moralmachine.net that aims to leverage public ethical opinion as a guidebook for future decisions. Last but not least, I raised a few questions regarding the role of bias in future robots.

The discussion that follows the presentation raised concerns towards the idea of using public opinion as the principles of making decision in autonomous driving. Some people argues that the car should make the difficult decisions based on their owner's preset preferences. I concludes the presentation by confirming the role of bias in our human nature -- it serves as a constant reminder of how the reality differs from our ideals and pushes us to act in real life.
