# Course Summary

The course *Robota Psyche* serves a reminder to me, a computer science major, that there are a lot to think about beyond the code and mathematics behind the machines. Most of my time, or the tech industry, is spent on making things more intelligent, more humanlike, and more convenient, but we seldom take the time to pause, contemplate, and reflect about the things we are building and their consequences to the society. Many of the times, we do not exactly have an answer to the questions we raised -- we hypothesize that robots will be superior than us, with respect to its absolute obedience to logics, while wrestling with the idea of infusing anthropic elements into the machines. There are many assumptions involved and reality might turned out to be nothing alike. Nonetheless, the course is asking us to stare at the void, a void that is increasingly widening as the technology progresses. As robots open up infinite possibilities for us, how do we design them so that it is ethical for us to interact with them in a way that is beneficial to the both sides? This class has interweaved this important question into my way of thinking about technology. But more importantly, as we probe the principles of robotics, we began a journey of introspection -- what defines us as humans, and only to find out surprisingly that we bear many similarities to the robots. In the end, we are looking at the **psyche** of *homo sapiens* through the lens of robots.



## The Ecosystem

A large part of the course is to develop a ecosystem, defined by a set of rules, of autonomous agents interacting with each other. I have used *processing* before, though in Python, to write a simple two-player game called [Space Hockey](https://github.com/cswpy/Space-Hockey) in my freshman year. I was able to revisit the same concepts in Java but with a totally different objective. The book [Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/) certainly unveiled an uncharted territory for me. How it was able to construct a model to capture the essence of nature and physics with rather simple and comprehensible code still fascinates me. Building from those principles, I developed my own [ecosystem](https://github.com/cswpy/RobotaPsyche/tree/master/Midterm), one where predator hunts the prey and prey forages the food. Again, the behaviors of the "creatures", derived from fairly simple and crude set of rules, exhibits complex heuristics that are not hardcoded into the system. Having only defined the predator chasing the preys, preys running away from the predator and running towards food, we could see that preys that are backed into a corner will get eaten while the ones roaming around get the food and are always a step ahead than the predator; as well as that each individual is driven by the randomized features encoded into them.



## Readings & Discussions

The readings, especially the discussions that follow them, are where ideas scintillate and spark. While I enjoyed all the discussions, below are the ones that I really loved.

### Affective Computer

Professor Oren Hanner gave us a gentle introduction of emotions and the requirements for a machine to qualify as *feeling machine*. Among the various theory of emotions, I particularly enjoyed the "emotions as motivations" and how they may be integrated into machines seamlessly. Machines, as of now, are motivation-based: they often seek a minimize a loss function or maximize a reward that is defined by programmers. Deriving emotions from a failure/success of doing so might be easy, but transcending the binary emotion of happy/sad and exhibits "cognitively generated emotions" and "emotional experience" are hard to realize.

### The Social Dilemma

In the film *The Social Dilemma*, we peek into the current abusive practices of big tech and tries to find a way out. Sadly, I realized that it is not easy to do so as an individual. As the society has transformed profoundly by social media, much of our lives are digitized. Severing any usage of social media apps is essentially severing a person to the society around him/her. The issue with the social media and the algorithms that run on them is that it creates many false illusions, illusions that potentially have negative and even irreversible impact to our lifestyle and mind, while keeping us all in the dark. 

### Isaac Asimov's *I, Robot*

Upon first look, Asimov's three laws of robotics may seem too natural and reasonable. They made sure that humans are prioritized, orders are obeyed, and then protect themselves. But through his series of short stories in *I, Robot*, I realize that there are a lot to think about in between the three laws. Should a robot prioritize the first law beyond everything else? How could we trust that the implementation of the three laws is ironclad? 



## Presentations

Presentations by the classmates are another place where I was put into new perspectives into new aspects of robotics. Below are some presentations that I loved.

### Xenobots

This is a [presentation by Yeji](https://github.com/yk1932/RobotaPsyche/blob/main/Presentation%20(Xenobots)/xenobots-compressed.pdf) that is about *proto-organism* that is built from frog embryo and acts according to a machine learning algorithm. The concept *Solipsism*, the idea that one's existence is the only thing that is real, and how Xenobots defies this concept is really intriguing. The biorobots further blur the boundary between humans and robots as now robots can now be made of cells instead of synthetic materials. 

### On Robots, Trust, and Bias

This is a [presentation by Chinonyerem](https://github.com/ChinoUkaegbu/RobotaPsyche/tree/main/Presentation) that is about trust and bias in robotics. It challenges the common misconception that machines are entirely fair and free of bias. Existing studies shows that people tend to trust robots more than a random person. Is this unreasonable or even harmful to humans when we place higher trust in robots while they could be as biased as a human? That's why explainable AI is essential for us to understand what is going on behind the algorithms and subsequently adjust our trusts in them.



## Conclusion

There are many many aspects relating to robotics that requires individual efforts to  think about as we march toward a robotic future. The class *Robota Psyche* asks some neglected, yet crucial questions about humans and how we design the robots.
