- [x] Color indication and transformation of age

- [x] Stroke color indicating critical hunger level

- [x] Predators search for preys with steering force

- [ ] 

- [ ] Add preys' steering force towards their food

- [ ] Add eating detection of preys eating their food

- [ ] Add reproduction mechaism

## Potential Features to Consider

1. How to implement the DNA class and a smooth mixture of two instances to create a new one

2. Adjust creature behaviors prior and post to eating

3. What random attributes could be introduced to further customize a creature's behavior
   
   - Max hunger threshold
   
   - Intention to mate
   
   - Intention to forage
   
   - Escape acceleration from the predator

4. Background image or color to better represent the environment they are living in
