## To Do List

- [x] Color indication and transformation of age

- [x] Stroke color indicating critical hunger level

- [x] Predators search for preys with steering force

- [x] Correctly deallocate preys after being eaten

- [x] Display status info (time elapsed, number of preys/food)

- [x] Add preys' steering force towards their food

- [x] Add eating detection of preys eating their food

- [ ] Add reproduction mechaism

## Potential Features to Consider

1. How to implement the DNA class and a smooth mixture of two instances to create a new one

2. Only preys within a range from the predator will sense the danger and would be repelled from it; otherwise the preys will just seek food

3. Adjust creature behaviors prior and post to eating

4. What random attributes could be introduced to further customize a creature's behavior
   
   - Max hunger threshold
   
   - Intention to mate
   
   - Intention to forage
   
   - Escape acceleration from the predator

5. Background image or color to better represent the environment they are living in
