## On the Fair and Ethical Usage of Deep Learning Models

With the introduction of neural networks, deep learning models have dominated almost every field of applications: speech/face recognition, clinical diagnosis, fraud detectionâ€¦and its performance is State of the Art (SOTA) in thousands of narrower fields. However, the training of deep learning models rely heavily on the training datasets. As the training dataset is a reflection of real-life, which is imbued with prejudice and bias from ourselves. Deploying a model with biased dataset and consider it "impartial" is heavily hazardous and caused serious consequences: NYPD arrested wrong person based on incorrect facial recognition results. What is the status quo of recognizing bias in machine learning models? What are the existing mechanism that avoids such issue? What should be in place to deal with future developments of more advanced and complex models with bias? And what we should do to ensure a fair and ethical usage of these models? This essay seeks the answers to those questions and attempts to present its arguments towards a better world.
