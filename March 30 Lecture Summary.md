Theory of Emotions

- Emotions as feelings
- Emotions as an awareness of physiological change
  - In response to external stimuli
  - Love: results of pheromones, hormones
  - Fear: response to threats
- Emotions as judgements
  - Beliefs + desire
  - Emotions change as we reappraise the beliefs
- Emotions as motivations
  - drivers for actions

### Affective Computers

Five components of emotions that any feeling machine should have

1. Emergent Emotions and Emotional Behavior
   Expression of emotions

2. Fast Primary Emotions
   Actions that precedes the perception of emotions

3. Cognitively Generated Emotions (Secondary Emotions)
   Emotions that arise out of reasoning

4. Emotional Experience
   Associate emotions with behaviors; Aware of the physiological processes accompanied with emotions; Internal subjective feeling

5. Body-mind Interactions
   Emotions influence cognition, subsequently intelligence.

   

> Why should robots exhibit emotions?

My answer: Robots exhibits emotions to mimic human behaviors. We want robots to exhibit emotions because we want them to be more human-like, even though a lot of the times emotions are not required or even relevant in their proper functioning. Only in cases where robots are supposed to act like a human are required to exhibit emotions. However, if we allow robots to act according to their emotions, would their actions work against the three laws of robotics? If so, should we constrain their actions produced by emotions?



Curiosity as an emotion --> Robots inquiring about things they don't yet understand or challenging existing knowledge

> I think the Ash replica is not in any sense an extension or continuity of Ash himself. He is merely a robot imitating what Ash have done and continues to exhibit the same behavior perpetually. There is no emotional reappraisal so to speak. I think of the robot as a snapshot of Ash at the exact moment when he died. I would not want anyone to create a replica of myself after I pass away -- it in a sense destroys the uniqueness of myself because there is some perfect machine that could replace my role in my family and my friends by imitating what I do. It also encourages the people around me to indulge themselves in a mirage of me, just like Martha did initially, which prevents them to creating new memories with new people.
